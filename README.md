# Crypto_coin_demo
the app is located in Django_web_app/crypto_demo

to start you need to have installed django on your machine

you can do that with : pip install django


</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
Next 
open a console then open the directory with manage.py
run : cd Django_web_app/crypto_demo
</br>
</br>
Then run: python manage.py runserver
</br>
</br>
The address where its hosted will be displayed on your console
</br>
</br>
Next step is to Initial the blockchain
</br>
The first step is to go address/admin/
and login 
</br>
Here is the admin login
username : admin
password : 1234
Note : once your logged in you should change the password
</br>
</br>
Then go to address/mod/</br>
and click "Create genesis block"</br>
once that is done , people can actually use the application
</br>
</br>
</br>

Theire is still one problem , there are no tokens on the actualle blockchain , so you need to create them in mod panel
</br>
</br>
</br>
After that people can finaly trade tokens on your blockchain
